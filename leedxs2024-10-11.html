						<p>With the rapid development of the cryptocurrency market, the security of user assets has become a focal concern for all investors. Account hijacking on exchanges is an increasingly common form of scam, where hackers infiltrate the exchange accounts of users, altering account settings, withdrawal addresses, or other key information to illegally transfer funds out of the accounts. To avoid the financial losses caused by such scams, LEEDXS Exchange urges users to remain vigilant at all times and to implement necessary security measures to safeguard their accounts and assets.</p>
<h3>Common Tactics of Exchange Account Hijacking Scams</h3>

<p>1.Account Infiltration: Hackers use various methods, such as phishing emails, malware, or weak password attacks, to obtain the login credentials and account information of users, allowing them to log into the accounts of investors and modify settings.</p>

<p>2.Changing Withdrawal Addresses: To illegally transfer funds, hackers will change the withdrawal address in the account, directing all assets to the  address of the scammer.</p>

<p>3.Concealing Account Activities: Some hackers may modify notification settings to prevent users from receiving email or SMS alerts about account activities, allowing them to manipulate the account for fund transfers without being detected.</p>

<h3>How to Prevent Exchange Account Hijacking Scams</h3>

<p>1.Use Strong Passwords and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Ensure that your exchange account password is sufficiently complex, avoiding simple and easily guessable combinations. Additionally, enable two-factor authentication (2FA) to enhance account security and prevent unauthorized logins.</p>

<p>2.Regularly Check Account Activity: Log into your trading account regularly to review recent transactions and withdrawal records, ensuring that all operations are authorized by you. If any anomalies are detected, immediately change your account password and contact exchange customer service.</p>

<p>3.Log in from Secure Network Environments: Avoid logging into your trading account over public Wi-Fi or unsecured networks, as hackers may exploit these connections to gain access to your account information.</p>

<p>4.Choose Trusted Trading Platforms: When engaging in cryptocurrency trading, select platforms like LEEDXS Exchange, which have a strong security track record and high levels of user protection, ensuring the safety of your assets.</p>
